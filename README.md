# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction

# Business Problem
Our primary goal is to extend loan services to individuals with limited or no credit history, who are often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders. To achieve this, we aim to maximize the efficiency of the loan approval process, ensuring timely and accessible financial support. Additionally, we strive to identify customers with high repayment ability while predicting and managing the risks associated with high-risk customers.

# Solution 
Our solution involves creating a robust Classification Predictive model designed to predict customers' risk of default accurately. This model will enable us to expand loan approvals to a broader customer base while strategically focusing on individuals with strong repayment capabilities. 

# Contribution to the Project 
Created a comprehensive table of contents, ensuring the project's organization and clarity. I handled categorical data by implementing label and one-hot encoding techniques and addressed missing values through imputation. Feature engineering for creating meaningful and relevant features for modeling. I applied data normalization and used the SMOTE technique to correct the imbalanced data. Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models with hyperparameter tuning and contributed to group discussion on valuable model findings.Drafted Business value of the model solution.

# Business Value of the Solution

# Challenges encountered along the way:
As a team, our major struggle revolved around getting everyone on the same page and regarding understanding the data. Each of us had different experiences with data and varying levels of comprehension of the project phases, making it quite challenging. Another difficulty was framing the business value of the solution and finding the best model for Home Credit. To overcome these hurdles, we delved into multiple articles on GitHub and other online platforms, exploring different techniques and seeking insights.

# Learnings
I thoroughly enjoyed progressing through the project phases, where I had the opportunity to work with real-time data in the banking sector for the first time. Understanding various aspects and technical terms of the loan approval process significantly contributed to my comprehension of the data. Focusing on business value and providing solutions to Home Credit resulted in improved model outcomes and interpretation. This project has provided me with a strong foundation in data science, significantly  enhancing my overall profile.
