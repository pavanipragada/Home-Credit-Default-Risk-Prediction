# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Prediction



Difficulties that your group encountered along the way:
As a team, our major struggle revolved around getting everyone on the same page and regarding understanding the data. Each of us had different experiences with data and varying levels of comprehension of the project phases, making it quite challenging. Another difficulty was framing the business value of the project and finding the best model for Home Credit. To overcome these hurdles, we delved into multiple articles on GitHub and other online platforms, exploring different techniques and seeking insights.

What you learned in the project:
I thoroughly enjoyed progressing through the project phases, where I had the opportunity to work with real-time data in the banking sector for the first time. Understanding various aspects and technical terms of the loan approval process significantly contributed to my comprehension of the data. Focusing on business value and providing solutions to Home Credit resulted in improved model outcomes and interpretation. This project has provided me with a strong foundation in data science, significantly  enhancing my overall profile.
